# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

Handwritten Digit Recognition is a Deep Learning web application that identifies handwritten digits (0–9) from uploaded images. The project uses the MNIST dataset to train a neural network model capable of recognizing handwritten digits with high accuracy. A Flask-based web interface allows users to upload an image and instantly receive the predicted digit along with the model's confidence score.
